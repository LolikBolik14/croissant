        <h3>What is a Croissant?</h3>
        <p class="about">
          A croissant is a flaky yeast baked product containing layers of
          dough/coagulated fat to create a flaky crunchy texture. Croissants are
          categorized as Viennoiserie baked goods or confectionery along with
          buns, Danish and puff pastries. A croissant usually contains normal
          amounts of salt, yeast, and sugar.1 The texture and flavor of
          croissants are determined by:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Lamination: a folding process creates alternating dough and fat
            layers
          </li>
          <li>
            Expansion: caused by the leavening action of yeast fermentation, and
            physical separation of the dough and fat layers during the oven
            spring stage of baking as the water trapped between them vaporizes
            to steam.
