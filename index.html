      <h3>What is a Croissant?</h3>
      <p class="about">
        A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains
        dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture. Croissants
        belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with
        brioche, Danish and puff pastries. A croissant usually contains normal
        levels of salt, yeast and sugar.1 The texture and eating quality of
        croissants are created:

      <ol>
        <li>
          Lamination: a folding process creates alternating dough and fat layers
        </li>
        <li>
          Expansion: caused by the leavening action of yeast fermentation, and
          physical separation of the dough and fat layers during the oven spring
          stage of baking as the water trapped between them vaporizes to steam.
