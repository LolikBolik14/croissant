        <h3>What is a Croissant?</h3>
        <p class="about">
          A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that
          contains dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture.
          Croissants belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked
          goods along with brioche, Danish and puff pastries. A croissant
          usually contains normal levels of salt, yeast and sugar.1 The texture
          and eating quality of croissants are created:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Lamination: a folding process creates alternating dough and fat
            layers
          </li>
          <li>
            Expansion: caused by the leavening action of yeast fermentation, and
            physical separation of the dough and fat layers during the oven
            spring stage of baking as the water trapped between them vaporizes
            to steam.
